* A simple smart contract for the Dice game for 2 players

## Rules to play ##
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to ""hold"": 
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to ""hold"", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
